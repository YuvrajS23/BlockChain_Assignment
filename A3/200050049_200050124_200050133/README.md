### Instructions to run the project
1. Run the ganache-cli using cmd “ganache-cli”(ubuntu) or “ganache”(windows).
2. In a seperate terminal, run the command “truffle migrate” to deploy the smart contract.
3. Contract address will be printed in the terminal after successful deployment. Copy this contract address to the client.py deployed_contract_address=” paste-contract-address”
4. Run the client.py. It will generate the topology.png and failed_transactions.png files apart from the other outputs for all the transactions.
